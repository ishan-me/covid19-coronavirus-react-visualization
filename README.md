### Coronavirus (Covid19) Animated Map and Infection Trajectories comparison


Main ideas:
- easier-to-understand, animated map with time travel capability
- charts for comparing countries and estimating where they are in their infection trajectory stage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), uses TypeScript, Material UI, Recharts, react-simple-maps, and now.sh for deployment.
